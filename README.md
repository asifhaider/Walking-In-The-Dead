## Walking_In_The_Dead
 
This is the very first project of my UnderGraduate Study Life at CSE, BUET. It was a team project.

### Developers : Md. Asif Haider (1805112, CSE, BUET) and Md. Azizur Rahman Anik (1805115, CSE, BUET)
## Project Superviser: [Shadman Saqib Eusuf](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty_list/detail/ssaqib)

As a part of our **Level 1 Term 1** Project on **Structured Programming Language (C)**, it was developed. We used **iGraphics** (OpenGL wrapper for the graphical demonstration).

Description : This is a 2D Zombie-Shooting Game named **Walking In The Dead**. The goal is to shoot the attacker zombies and gain points to pass the levels. Further instructions on Gameplay and How to Play can be found at the **How to Play** section inside the game. There is also a **High Score** section to enlist your best scores. Play the **Gameplay.mp4** video to take a look at the game. 

To run the game, do any of the following inside **Game** folder: 
- run **OpenGL.exe** or, 
- build and run **IGraphics.cbp** 

Follow the instructions found inside the game to proceed and complete. Enjoy and Feel free to criticize. 

Note: All the codes are created and edited solely by the developers. Although, the background images and audio files are collected from the Internet, then edited to make useable.
